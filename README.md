# 🔗 LittleLink-Server

LittleLink-Server is a lightweight, self-hosted link page for publishing a profile, avatar, social links, custom buttons, metadata, analytics, and health checks from environment variables.

It is inspired by [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink) and built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), React, and TypeScript. The container image uses Next.js standalone output so the production runtime stays small and only includes the files needed to serve the app.

## 👇 What is LittleLink-Server?

LittleLink-Server takes the same simple approach as LittleLink and packages it as a configurable Node.js application. Pass environment variables to control page metadata, theme, profile content, social links, custom buttons, analytics providers, and health check behavior.

Configuration is evaluated at request time. Rebuilds are not required when environment values change, but containers should be restarted so the running process receives the new values.

## Developer Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 or later
- Yarn Classic 1.22.x

### Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server with hot reload
yarn dev

# Run type checking
yarn typecheck

# Run tests
yarn test

# Run lint, style, markdown, type, and unit test checks
yarn ci

# Build for production
yarn build

# Start production server
yarn start

# Run Playwright e2e tests
yarn test:e2e
```

### File conventions

This project uses TypeScript. The file extension tells you what the file contains:

- `.ts` for code without JSX (server, configuration, utilities)
- `.tsx` for React components and tests that contain JSX

If you use VS Code, set the workspace TypeScript version:

1. Open any `.ts` or `.tsx` file.
2. Click the TypeScript version in the bottom-right status bar.
3. Select **Use Workspace Version** (the one listed next to `node_modules/typescript`).

For contribution workflow, validation, and button guidance, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Runtime configuration

Environment values are always strings and are read at **request time**, not at build time. No `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix or `env` block is needed. Changes take effect after a container restart without rebuilding the image.

### Sitemap

LittleLink-Server exposes `/sitemap.xml` when `OG_URL` is configured and `META_INDEX_STATUS` allows indexing. The sitemap contains the single public profile URL and is generated at request time from environment variables.

```bash
OG_URL=https://links.example.com
META_INDEX_STATUS=all
```

If `OG_URL` is not set, or `META_INDEX_STATUS` contains `noindex`, `/sitemap.xml` returns `404`.

### Robots

LittleLink-Server generates `/robots.txt` at request time. By default, `META_INDEX_STATUS=all` allows crawling and adds a sitemap link when `OG_URL` is configured. Missing or `noindex` metadata disallows crawling.

```bash
META_INDEX_STATUS=all
OG_URL=https://links.example.com
```

Use `ROBOTS_ADDITIONAL_RULES` to append crawler-specific rules. Escaped `\n` sequences are converted to new lines, which works well in container environment variables.

```bash
ROBOTS_ADDITIONAL_RULES=User-agent: GPTBot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /
```

Use `ROBOTS_TXT` when you need to replace the generated file entirely.

```bash
ROBOTS_TXT=User-agent: *\nDisallow: /private
```

### Docker build

```bash
docker build -t littlelink-server .
docker run -p 8080:3000 littlelink-server
```

### Using Kubernetes

[Unofficial helm chart provided by k8s-at-home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/tree/master/charts/stable/littlelink-server)

```bash
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install littlelink-server \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
  --set env.META_TITLE="TechnoTim"
    k8s-at-home/littlelink-server
```

Or use a values.yaml file:

`helm install littlelink-server k8s-at-home/littlelink-server -f values.yaml`

## 🧬 DNA helix layout

An optional layout that renders your links as the base pairs of a scrolling
DNA double helix instead of a vertical list. It is off by default; set
`LAYOUT=dna` to turn it on and `LAYOUT=list` (or leave it unset) to keep the
original page.

```yaml
environment:
  - LAYOUT=dna
  - HELIX_STYLE=bio      # bio | chroma | clinical
  - HELIX_TURNS=2        # whole turns across the full list
  - HELIX_RADIUS=172     # helix radius in pixels
  - HELIX_RISE=90        # vertical gap between base pairs, in pixels
  - HELIX_DRIFT=true     # turn slowly while the pointer is away
```

The strand is driven by the wheel, a drag, a swipe, or the arrow keys, and it
loops endlessly in both directions: run off the end of your list and you come
straight back into the start of it.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LAYOUT` | `list` | `dna` enables the helix. Any other value keeps the stock list. |
| `HELIX_STYLE` | `bio` | `bio` tints each button as lit glass over a cyan strand, `chroma` keeps full brand colours against a violet strand, `clinical` is a monochrome treatment with brand colour on hover. |
| `HELIX_TURNS` | `2` | Whole turns of the helix across the whole list, 1-6. **Must be a whole number**: the list wraps by shifting a button one full list-length along the strand, so the twist across that shift has to be a whole number of revolutions or the loop would visibly jump. |
| `HELIX_RADIUS` | `172` | 90-320. Reduced automatically to fit narrow viewports. |
| `HELIX_RISE` | `90` | 50-190. Scaled automatically on short viewports. |
| `HELIX_DRIFT` | `true` | Set `false` to hold the strand still until it is scrolled. Drift is also suppressed while the pointer is over the page and whenever the visitor prefers reduced motion. |

Every button stays an ordinary anchor in the document, so links remain
crawlable, keyboard-navigable and right-click-copyable. Only the backbone and
the background are drawn to canvas. Buttons keep the brand colours they
already had; the helix reads them at runtime rather than requiring any button
definition to know about the layout.

The helix commits to a dark scene whatever `THEME` is set to, because the
strands are lit objects in a dark field.

## 👤 Long-form bio

Set `BIO_LONG` and the avatar becomes a button that opens a profile panel.
Leave it unset and the avatar stays a plain image, exactly as before. This
works in both layouts.

```yaml
environment:
  - BIO_TAGS=Systems Engineer,Speaker,Photographer
  - BIO_LONG=|
      The first paragraph is shown as a lede.

      Separate paragraphs with a blank line. Soft-wrapped lines inside a
      paragraph are joined back together.
```

`\n\n` is accepted in place of real blank lines, which is easier to write on a
single line in a `.env` file. When `LINKED_IN` is set, the panel closes with a
link to it.

## 🔧 Configuration

See [docs/analytics.md](docs/analytics.md) for analytics setup instructions and [docs/healthcheck.md](docs/healthcheck.md) for health check configuration.

Environment variables are read at request time, so changes take effect after a container restart without rebuilding the image.
